# Smart Guide Application
Travelling adds colors and new experiences to our life. It enables one to learn something new, break the boundaries, and expand a mindset. Indeed, the importance of tourism is hard to overestimate. It is the easiest way to learn about a country, its culture, and the people. People’s traveling decisions are getting harder for them because every short period there is a new place to go to or a new activity to do. After a detailed search to help in that problem we saw that the solution is providing the touristic place with its activities in the same place, so that the person searching doesn’t get tired of going to multiple apps or sites to find all the details about the place. We made Smart Guide to make trip places selection easier. We add every activity the place has when we add it to the application. The user can search by the place name or by selecting activities from a checkbox. So, we fix the little problems that families or travelers have when choosing a place to go to.
This project makes touristic places searching services easier than the traditional systems.In this project we have used Java to build the application, Firebase as Real-time database, and XML as a design language.
